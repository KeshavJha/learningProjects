* JavaScript is case-sensitive language.
JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs, and also ignores line breaks.

* Literal is a data value that appears directly in a program. e.g. 12 or 1.2 ( number ) , "hello world" or 'Hello world' , true ( boolean ), null .

* Identifiers are used to name constants, variables, properties, functions and classes, and to provide labels for certain loops.
    Identifiers must begin with letter, underscore or dollar sign. Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores or dollar signs.

    Digits are not allowed as first character.

* Reserved words can't be used as identifiers.
    as , async , await , break , case , catch , class , const , continue,

    debugger , default , delete , do , else , export , extends , false , finally , for , from , function , 

    get , if , import , in , instanceof , let , new , null , of , return , set , static , super , switch , 

    target , this , throw , true , try , typeof , var , void , while , with , yield

* Some reserved words that are not currently used but might be used in future versions 

    enum , implements , interface , package , private , protected , public 

* Some reserved words historically, still not allowed as identifiers - arguments , eval 

* JavaScript programs are written using Unicode character set, and any Unicode characters can be used in strings and comments.

* Semicolon at end of statements can optionally be ommitted at end of programs or of next token is a closing curly brace. 
    JavaScript treats line breaks as semicolons if it can't parse the code without adding an implicit semicolon, i.e if next nonspace character cannot be interpreted as a continuation of the current statement.
